For our group project, we are making a vacation rentals website based on the vacasa api.  It will have the same functionallity as the solo project.  However, we will have a main display page added.  

The api also incorporated google maps into the window which I am hoping to make work.  

There will be a favorites page with certain criteria you can look through to make a final decesion.  

As far as assignments,  I, Evan, will be backend.  Fernando will be front-end.  And if our third member shows up we will fit him into css.
